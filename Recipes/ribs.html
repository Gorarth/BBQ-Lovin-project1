                Baby Back Ribs
            </h1>
            <p class="information_text">
                One of the most famous cuts for BBQ and compitation, this cut of pork is easy to cook, but extreamly hard to master. You will see and hear BBQ enthusiasts talk about many different methods for cooking these.
                <br>
                A common way to a 3:2:1 method, where you cook for 3 hours, wrap in tin foil for 2 hours and then lick and glaze for the last hour. However we find it to make the ribs too mushy and we go for a 4 hour cook.
                <br>
                You can make it happen with different methods but here's my real smoked ribs recipe, good enough to bring home a trophy in a cook-off.
                <br>
                <Br>
                What you will need is;
                </p>
                <ul class="information_list">
                    <li>Your ribs, around 800g per full rack</li>
                    <li>Smoking equipment</li>
                    <li>Spray bottle with 9:1 ratio of apple juice:cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>Our Memphis rub</li>
                    <li>Bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2 class="information_h2">
                    Prep and Trim
                </h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                    Firstly, you want to trim any excess fat off and take off the membrane on the back of the ribs. It gets leathery and hard to chew, it keeps fat in, and it keeps sauce out. To remove it, insert a butter knife under the membrane, then your fingers, work a section loose, grip it with per towel, and peel it off.
                </p>
                <h2 class="information_h2">
                    Rub
                </h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                    Lightly wet the ribs. Once wet, sprinkle enough Memphis Dust to coat all surfaces but not so much that the meat doesn't show through. That is about 2 tablespoons per side depending on the size of the slab. Spread the Memphis Dust on the meat and rub it in.
                </p>

                <p class="information_text">
                Prepare your smoker for cooking, we want to get it upto around 235°F. Set up for indirect cooking. Once your smoker is at 235°F we are ready to cook!

                <h2 class="information_h2">
                The Cooking
                </h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                Put the slabs in the cooker in indirect heat, meaty side up, close the lid, go drink a beer, read a book, or make love.
                <br>
                <br>
                For cooking time, allow 5 to 7 hours for St. Louis Cut Ribs or Spare Ribs, and 3 to 5 hours for Baby Back Ribs. Thicker, meatier slabs take longer.
                <br>
                <br>
                When it is time to find out whether or not the ribs are ready, we us the bend test (a.k.a. the bounce test). To conduct the bend test, pick up the slab with tongs and bounce it gently. If the surface cracks it is ready.
                </p>
                <h2 class="information_h2">
                Lick the Ribs
                </h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                Once the ribs are done cooking it is time to add the sauce. The key to saucing ribs is to go easy on it so that the meat can shine through. Simply paint both sides of the rack with your favorite barbecue sauce and cook for another 15 minutes or so.  Don't put the sauce on earlier than that. It has sugar and there is a risk it can burn.

                <p class="information_text">Just say no to crockpot pulled pork recipes and hello to the real deal. It's sure to be the best smoked BBQ pulled pork recipe you've ever had the pleasure to eat!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                You will find countless non-barbecue websites out there promoting their “quick and easy pulled pork recipe,” Which will say to cook in a crockpot, Instapot, or other slow cooker. While the end result may LOOK somewhat like BBQ pulled pork, it really isnt. There really is no substitute for an authentic smoked pulled pork recipe that has been cooked in a smoker or grill.</p>
                <p class="information_text">
                    All you will need is:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="information_list">
                        <li>1 pork butt, or collar</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup of our Memphis rub</li>
                        <li>Your favorite barbecue sauce</li>
                        <li>Your smoking equipment</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 class="information_h2">Prep</h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                    Trim off most of the fat, while leaving 5mm of fat still on. leaving too much on will cause the smoke to not be able to penetrate the meat.
                    <br>
                    Now that your pork is preped, you want to season with our memphis rub all over and leave to rest for 4-8 hours, or overnight.
                </p>
                <h2 class="information_h2">Fire up The Coals</h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                    Prepare your smoker for cooking, we want to get it upto around 235°F. Set up for indirect cooking. Once your smoker is at 235°F we are ready to cook!
                </p>

                <h2 class="information_h2">The Cook</h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                    Before we put the pork on, lets put some more rub onto the meat. You'll notice the rub has soaked into the meat, which is going to help give us more flavour. But we want some extra fresh rub on now to give us a lovely crisp bark.
                <br>
                    Now the rub is applied, lets put the pork on the smoker on the grates. 
                <br>
                    While its cooking, we want to make sure the smoker doesn't drop below 225°F and doesn't go above 260°F. Pork butts and collars are forgiving, so if the heat changes loads, it shouldnt effort it too much.
                </p>
                <h2 class="information_h2">Checking the Temp</h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                    We want the internal temperature to hit around 205°F, this is going to take between 8-14 hours depending on the size and how well you maintain a steady heat. 
                <br>
                    The exterior should be a nice dark brown color, almost black. It isn't burnt and nor will it taste burnt. There will be pink parts to the pork and this is normal, this is called a smoke ring and is in fact, a good thing.
                </p>
                <h2 class="information_h2">The Pulling</h2>
                <p class="information_text">
                    Now that we are cooked, we want to rest the meat for a good 30mins before we do anything else. Let is rest in a pan or tray and after 30mins we can start to pull!
                    <br>
                    I prefer using tongs or hands, and leaving it all quite chunky. But you can also use a fork or claws for a more shredded look. Its completely personal choice here!
                    <br>
                    Once you have pulled it, its ready for the BBQ sauce, and eating! Chuck it in a brioche bap, or top a burger with it. the choice is endless!

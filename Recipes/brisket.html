                    <h2 class="information_h2">Trim</h2>
                    <p class="information_text">
                       Trim off most of the cat cap, but make sure to leave 1/4 inch on. Clean the meaty side of any silverskin, a shiny thin tough membrane.  
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="information_h2">Season</h2>
                    <p class="information_text">
                        Make sure to season the brisket at least one hour before you plan to cook. Longer is more advised but no longer than 12hours.
                        <br><br>
                        Rub your brisket in the French's yellow mustard, very lightly. This will help your rub stick to the brisket better.
                        Once the mustard has been applyed, Start to sprinkle the big bad beefy rub all over the brisket, not forgetting the sides. Rather than a "rub" method on the brisket, you want to sprinkle and then push lightly to create a well coated and even "bark"
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="information_h2">Fire Up The Coals</h2>
                    <p class="information_text">
                        Pre-heat your smoker, or if you are using a grill, set up for indirect cooking. Get the cooker temp stabilized at around 235째F.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="information_h2">The Cook</h2>
                    <p class="information_text">
                    Now the fun starts, Place your meat on the cooker, make sure to add your wood now to start the smoking process, you want around 3 cups of wood. Keep an eye on the temp of the smoker, we dont want it to go much below 215째F. You can add more coals or adjust the amount of air coming into the smoker to increase the temp.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="information_h2">Wrapping</h2>
                    <p class="information_text">
                    This is optional but advised. Once your meats internal temperature reachs around 170째F, you may want to wrap the meat in butchers paper or foil. The Brisket will enter a phase called "the stall" and will sit in that phase for awhile where the temp wont increase. Wrapping it speeds this process up and cooks the brisket faster.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="information_h2">Check the Temp</h2>
                    <p class="information_text">
                    Once the internal temperature reaches around 200째F, we want to start feeling the brisket. Use your probe to slide in and out of the brisket, you want to feel very little resistance. give a poke with your finger and feel the jiggle. if it wiggles like jelly, its ready! 
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="information_h2">Slicing</h2>
                    <p class="information_text">
                    Never slice right away. You want to leave the brisket to rest for atleast 30mins. This will help keep alot of that moisture inside the brisket. Once you slice brisket it starts to dry out fast, so wait until everything is ready until you slice.
                    <br><br>
                    You can slice however you want. Some people like large fat cubes, others like thin long slices.
                    <br>
                    Personally i like slices, so start to slice, against the grain so you want the brisket like a rectangle, with the side you slice being the smaller side.

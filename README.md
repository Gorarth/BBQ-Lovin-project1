    - The Navigation bar is designed so the users can easily navigate between pages, no matter what page they are on.

    - You can also easily tell which nav bar is which due to the lack of logo on mobile, this was due to space and found that with the logo on the nav bar, the writing was too small and/or too fidderly to click

3. The Gallery
    - Our Gallery will give the users lots of images to see what kind of food they can expect to be cooking using our recipes. 
    
    - It's important for the images to stand out to give the users that "food envy" effect and make them want to eat it. Giving them a polaroid effect and a stacked look, the users can clearly see all photos and make them salavate.

    - the mobile version of the gallery is a stacked single column. The "instagram scroll" effect. People spend there lifes scrolling down on sites and this is no different. Different pictures as they scroll will make them want try the food and therefore cook it.

## Features
### Existing Features

1. #### Navigation Bar
    
    - You will find the Navigation bar on all pages. It is responsive and intuitive. 
    
    - On desktop/laptop, you can hover over the black side bar which has the logo, home, gallery and a burger, to reveal the full navigation bar with links around the site.
    
    - On Mobile you will find the tradition 3 line "burger" icon. When clicked will reveal the mobile version of the navigation bar. You can also click the 3 bars to close the navigation, if you wanted to stay where you were.

    - The Navigation bar is designed so the users can easily navigate between pages, no matter what page they are on.

    - You can also easily tell which nav bar is which due to the lack of logo on mobile, this was due to space and found that with the logo on the nav bar, the writing was too small and/or too fidderly to click

<br>

2. #### Landing Page
    - The first image seen on the landing page is of chicken wings and our LED Logo sign.
    
    - Users will instantly see our logo, along with the chicken wings, giving them the idea they are in the right place for what they came for - BBQ Food.

    - the bright colors of the LED sign will grab there attention, along with the food presented infront of them.

        - <img align="center" src="assets/readmeimages/landingpage.png" height="400px">
        <br>
3. #### The Gallery
    - Our Gallery will give the users lots of images to see what kind of food they can expect to be cooking using our recipes. 
    
    - It's important for the images to stand out to give the users that "food envy" effect and make them want to eat it. Giving them a polaroid effect and a stacked look, the users can clearly see all photos and make them salavate.

    - the mobile version of the gallery is a stacked single column. The "instagram scroll" effect. People spend there lifes scrolling down on sites and this is no different. Different pictures as they scroll will make them want try the food and therefore cook it.
        - <img src="assets/readmeimages/site-gallery.png" height="400px">
        <br>
4. #### Recipe Pages
    - the recipes within the site are the main reason people will come to the website.
    
    - the pages are spread out in a way that it is easy to follow by just scrolling down, with photos between some of the steps to help the user know what to do.
    <br>

### Future Features 

1. #### Search Options
    - Once the site has more recipes, I can implement a search bar using keywords to find recipes based on the users search word.

2. #### News and membership
    - Once the website has received a good amount of traffic and repeat users, i can implement a news section and a membership club
        - The News section can be viewable by all and include information like
            - new recipes
            - new BBQ/smoker options
            - Event updates from compitions
        - Membership club can include an email subscription, which can send emails when the news is updated. could also implement a hidden forum for bbq enthusiasts to come together and discuss there own recipes and troubleshoot any problems they have to other members.

# Testing

I tested the project throughout building the site. I used the browser option within GitPod and then used Google Dev Tools to assit in extra tests. 

In my mid meeting with my mentor, we desided to move away from the first draft look on wireframes as it didnt flow nicely between the information given out, and the landing page needed to be more "in your face" with what we are about, the food.

We went for a more parallax view with the images coming and going as you scroll down.

## Manual Testing

I Manually tested the website on a number of different mobile devices using google chrome developer tools to make sure they where responsive. 
- iPhone 13 Pro
- iPhone 12 Pro
- Pixel5
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- iPad Air
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- Surface Pro 7 

I also tested the website on a number of browsers.
- Google Chrome
- Firefox 
- Microsoft Edge

With these tests i test every single link from each page on the navigation bar. All links worked and lead to where expect. Links leading to external page also opened in a new tab.

All images displayed correctly and didn't cause any issues on the devices tested.

## Validator Testing

- all HTML Pages and CSS file has been through validator testing with zero problems back.

    - CSS <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
            <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
                src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
                alt="Valid CSS!" />
        </a>

 ## Solved Bugs

 - Images and links on deployed site failed to load and had incorrect paths. This was solved when i changed the file paths using ../, using the . to go back from the current folder. 

 <img align="center" src="assets/readmeimages/image bug.png" height="200px"><img align="center" src="assets/readmeimages/page bug.png" height="200px">

 - the images used was making the load of the page take way too long. This was easily fixed when i changed them from jpeg to webp and compressed them down.

 - one of the images wasnt displaying after compressing them. found the file path was wrong and changed to correct path to fix.

## Features
### Existing Features
<br>

1. #### Navigation Bar
    
    - You will find the Navigation bar on all pages. It is responsive and intuitive. 
    
    - On desktop/laptop, you can hover over the black side bar which has the logo, home, gallery and a burger, to reveal the full navigation bar with links around the site.
    
    - On Mobile you will find the tradition 3 line "burger" icon. When clicked will reveal the mobile version of the navigation bar. You can also click the 3 bars to close the navigation, if you wanted to stay where you were.

    - The Navigation bar is designed so the users can easily navigate between pages, no matter what page they are on.

    - You can also easily tell which nav bar is which due to the lack of logo on mobile, this was due to space and found that with the logo on the nav bar, the writing was too small and/or too fidderly to click

2. #### Landing Page
    - The first image seen on the landing page is of chicken wings and our LED Logo sign.
    
    - Users will instantly see our logo, along with the chicken wings, giving them the idea they are in the right place for what they came for - BBQ Food.

        <br>
3. #### The Gallery
    - Our Gallery will give the users lots of images to see what kind of food they can expect to be cooking using our recipes. 
    
    - It's important for the images to stand out to give the users that "food envy" effect and make them want to eat it. Giving them a polaroid effect and a stacked look, the users can clearly see all photos and make them salavate.

    - the mobile version of the gallery is a stacked single column. The "instagram scroll" effect. People spend there lifes scrolling down on sites and this is no different. Different pictures as they scroll will make them want try the food and therefore cook it.

4. #### Recipe Pages
    - the recipes within the site are the main reason people will come to the website.
    
    - the pages are spread out in a way that it is easy to follow by just scrolling down, with photos between some of the steps to help the user know what to do.
